# A Hands-on Approach for learning concepts of computer networking 

### About the repository
This repository is a collection of juypter (python) notebooks which cover the theory as well as implementations of different algorithms found in Computer Networking. Our objective behind creating this repository is to facilitate a hands-on learning experience for students where they are able to understand,

  1. Theory behind different algorithms used in Computer Networking
  2. Learn about implementing the algorithms in python 
  3. Interactively visualize the algorithms at work, to increase  their understanding of the algorithm
  
  
 ### About us
These notebooks are created by the Centre for Networked Intelligence which is under the division of EECS and RBCCPS, IISc, aims to develop next generation networking methodologies and concept solutions that can derive knowledge from evolved networks of the future. The centre aims to build network applications and public policies for the benefit of society in areas such as smart cities, IoT/CPS, data exchanges etc.
