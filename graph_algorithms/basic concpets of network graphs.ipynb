    "\n",
    "While this is a slight deviation from the actual topic of implementing Dijkstra's Algorithm, it is important to describe the two ways of representing a graph on paper (or) code namely the **Adjacency List** and **Adjacency Matrix**. This section will not be a detailed explanation about these representations but the purpose is to introduce how graph representations can help in implementing graph-based algorithms. In case you are interested in reading more about the graph representations check out [0_graphs and graph_representations](#).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adjacency Matrix** in a nutshell is a ($n * n$) square matrix which indicates if two vertices are connected by an edge or not. Adjacency matrices are used since they are intutive and helps to visualize the graphs. However, as the graphs get bigger the runtime of using an adjacency matrix increases, more information can be found on the [running_time section](#).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is the adjacency matrix representation for the graph considered as an example. In this matrix, each row and column represents one node. For example row \"1\" and column \"1\" will be associated with Node \"1\" (or `b (in code)`) in the visualized graph above. Each element in this matrix represents an edge, which is either denoted as (0,1) for an unweighted graph or with a value which corresponds to the weight of the edge. In our graph, for Node 1, we have three edges namely:\n",
    "1. (1,0) -> 1   `in code they correspond to graphs,connect(a,b,1)`\n",
    "2. (1,2) -> 10  `in code they correspond to graphs,connect(b,c,10)`\n",
    "3. (1,3) -> 6   `in code they correspond to graphs,connect(b,d,6)`\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, since the graph is undirected, we notice that the adjacency matrix as well its trasponse are symmetrcical, which indicates the connections are bidirectional. The bidirectional nature of the edge can be observed in the matrix where the statement `graphs,connect(a,b,1)` has the edge presence for both (0,1) -> 1 and (1,0) -> 1 cases on the adjacency matrix."

While adjacency matrix representations consume $O(n^2)$, adjacency lists consume $O(m)$ where $m$ refers to the number of edges adjacent to the node. The space saved in the memory also results in a faster lookups when adjacency lists are used. \n",
