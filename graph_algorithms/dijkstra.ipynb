    "## Implementing Dijkstra shortest path algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Notes**\n",
    "1. The algorithm cannot have negative edge weights. \n",
    "   **Reason:** Negative weights will adversely affect the distance comparison step, meaning the greedy approach of always finding the shortest path will not be met.\n",
    "2. Dijkstra's algorithm is commonly implemented to find all the shortest paths from the source Node. In this notebook, you are shown both the implementation of finding all the shortest paths from the source and the shortest path between a given source and target node. The paths found by the Sijkstra's algorithm are the absolute shortest path, which we explain in the [Proof of Correctness](#) section.\n",
    "3. We will also be demonstrating the implementation of the Dijkstra's algorithm using the adjacency list as well as the adjacency matrix representations of a graph. We also add the optimized implementaiton of the Dijkstra's algorithm which makes it asymptotically faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the algorithm\n",
    "The idea behind Dijkstra's algorithm is to find the shortest path from a source Node to all the nodes (or) a specific target node on the graph without checking every source-to-destination combination. The drawback of considering every source-to-destination combination means that the computation of shortest path in large graphs becomes time consuming and cumbersome to check if we have the shortest path. Thus, the Dijkstra's algorithm proposed a greedy approach where the shortest path to the target is taken by considering the minimum distance to be travelled at a given time. [[2]](https://medium.com/cantors-paradise/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-in-python-d955744c7064)\n",
    "\n",
    "<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"steps1\"></a>\n",
    "### Algorithm steps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setup()**\n",
    "1. Set distance to all node nodes from the `source` as `infinity`\n",
    "2. Define an empty list of `seen_nodes`. This helps us to prevent compute the shortest path for nodes where the shortest path is already computed. The nodes that are added ot the `seen_nodes` are the ones for which have the absolute shortest path. In order, to ensure a shorter look-up time for shortest path we use `set()` datastructure which optimizes the look-up time at O(1) instead of O(n) when a `list()` data structure is used.\n",
    "3. Set the distance from the source node to itself as 0, and the array representing the hops taken to reach the shortest path to contain the source node itself. This means that we can back-track the hops taken to reach the shortest path from the source node.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loop()**\n",
    "4. **While** there exists a node in the queue that is not `seen`:\n",
    "5. Set the current node as the node with the smallest distance (in code, referred as `min_node` and `min_dist`). In the first iteration of the loop, this will be the source node and thus we set the `dist` as 0.\n",
    "6. Add the current node, `min_node` to the `seen` set\n",
    "7. Update the total distance (`tot_dist`) for each neighbors of the current node, `min_node` to be the absolute distance from `min_node` to `source` added with the edge length from the `min_node` to its neighbor, **IF** this value is less than the current distance computed for `min_node`'s neighbor. \n",
    "    If this neighbor is not seen, then since `tot_dist` is initiated to infinity, the computed sum of `tot_dist` should be less than this sum. If we update the `tot_dist`, we also update the hops (previous nodes) that were used to reach this distance by concatenating the hops of `min_node` along with `min_node` to the `source` node.\n",
    "8. **End While**\n",

Dijkstra's algorithm terminates by computing the shortest distance to node $u$  from the source node $s$, $$d[u] = \\delta(s,u) \\forall u \\in V$$. In this expression $d[u]$ denotes the distance computed by the Dijkstra's algorithm and $\\delta(s,u)$ denotes the actual shortest distance to node $u$  from the source node $s$.\n",

To show that the equality condition holds we consider the property in which there exists  $d[u] \\geq \\delta(s,u) \\forall u \\in V$ and once $d[v]$ achieves the value of $\\delta(s,v)$ it does not change.\n",

    "## Optimizing using adjacency list representation and priority queues\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have clear distinction that adjacency list representation offers a better algorithmic performance over adjacency matrix. We would like to see if we could optimize the algorithmic performance of our implementation of the Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why optimize?\n",
    "Dijkstra's shortest path is already a greedy algorithm which saves computation and time, since in every iteration of the algorithm, we find the node with smallest distance before making our next greedy decision. This decision-making step ensures that not every possible source-destination combination is checked in order to determine the shortest path.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our implementation of the Dijkstra's algorithm, so far, we search through a list, `queue` based on the values of `dist`. The maximum length of `queue` is the number of nodes$(n)$ in the graph, therefore iterating along the `queue` takes $O(n)$ time. Since, we terminate only when all the nodes are visited, that is the length of `seen` set is the number of nodes in the graph, we are doing the $O(n)$ operation of iterating through the nodes n-times, making the total running time of our implementation to become $O(n^2)$. Now, if we look at our graph representation, we use an adjacency matrix, which means to find the connections (or) the edges for a particular node, we iterate through the entire matrix row which has the length equal to the number of nodes in the graph. This adds another $O(n)$ time while iteration while looping through each node in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization Steps\n",
    "1. Instead of iterating through the entire row of the adjacency matrix representation of the graph to find the nodes adjacent to the current node at $O(n)$ time, we use the adjacency list representation which could reduce the time to find adjacent nodes to $O(k)$ where `k` refers to the number of edges for the node.\n",
    "2. Instead of maintaining a list of nodes and iterating over them at $O(n)$ time, we can use a [Binary Heap](https://medium.com/cantors-paradise/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-in-python-d955744c7064)\n",
    " which helps to find the node with the minimum distance at $O(log(n))$ or use a [Fibonacci Heap](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/715934) which will make the task to find the nodes with minimum distance at $O(1)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"heaps\"></a>\n",
    "### What are Heaps?\n",
    "Heaps are binary trees where every parent node has a value less than or equal to any of its children. In other words, this type of queue keeps track of the minimum value. Thus it helps retrieve the minimum value at all times. For this reason, it is also referred to as min heap. Thus, position 0 holds the smallest/minimum value. There is also a max heap whose operation is quite similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** heap queues or priority queues don’t sort lists in ascending order. It just keeps the smallest element in its 0th position. The rest of the elements may or may not be sorted.[1](https://www.pythoncentral.io/priority-queue-beginners-guide/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we shall only look at heaps as efficient data strucutres to build priority queues, but you can read more about heaps on these articles from [tutorialspoint.com](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/heap_data_structure.htm) and [hackerearth.com](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/data-structures/trees/heapspriority-queues/tutorial/) to get some more insights on the heap data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"pseudocode2\"></a>\n",
    "### How the current algorithm changes?\n",
    "**Using Priority Queues:** Now, we are using heaps to implement priority queues because heaps effficiently handle situations of removing the node with the highest priority. In the context of Dijkstra's algorithm, the highest priority is the smallest distance computed to visit the remaining unvisited nodes. Instead of iterating over a list to find the node with minimum distance, we use the heap where the node with the minimum distance is already ready. After removing this node from the heap, the heap re-arranges itself based on the \"heap property\". \n",
    "\n",
    "**Updated Pseudocode:**\n",
    "Dijkstra's algorithm is optimized by using a min-priority queue. The reason for selecing a min-priority queue is because, the greedy condition of the algorithm selects the edge with the minimum distance. \n",

    "The running time of the Dijkstra's algorithm is computed with respect to the number of nodes (|V|) and number of edges (|E|) on the graph. However, the perforamnce or running time of the Dijkstra's algorithm is determined by the data strucutre that is used to implement the set of unvisited nodes. The upper bound of the Dijkstra's algorithm can be simply approximated as $O(|V|^2)$, however, this approximation is an over-simplified expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the implementation of the set of univisited nodes, the running time expression for the Dijkstra's algorithm can be $O(|E|\\cdot T_{\\mathrm {dk} }+|V|\\cdot T_{\\mathrm {em} })$ where $T_{\\mathrm {dk}}$ represents the time complexity of removing the current seen node and $T_{\\mathrm {em}}$ represents the time complexity for removing the node which has the minimum distance. \n",
    "\n",
    "While using the adjacency matrix representation, the time complexity for removing the node with the minimum distance can be defined as the time taken to perform a linear search across all the unvisited nodes, and so, the running time is represented as $O(|E|+|V|^2) = O(|V|^2)$. For a dense graph that is represented as an adjacency list, the running time can be represented as $O((|V|^2) log(V))$\n",
    "\n",
    "When the graph is sparse i.e. the graph has fewer than $|V|^2$ edges, Dijkstra's algorithm can be implemented efficiently using adjacency lists for representing the graph and min-heaps for extracting the nodes with minimum distance in each iteration. In our implementaiton, the min-heap is implemented using the [`heapq package`](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/heapq.html) which takes $O(log(E))$ to pop (or) remove the node with minimum distance from the heap and it takes $O((|V|) log(V))$ to build the heap. Thus, the total running time for the implementation with the `heapq pacakge` is $O((|E| + |V|) log(V))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: It is possible to improve the efficiency of the algorithm using [Fibonacci heaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_heap) and [Binary Heaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap) which are not discussed in this notebook. It is also recommended to refer the [A* algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) if "
