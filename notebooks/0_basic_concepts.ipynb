    "In this notebook we would be introducing the notion of why networks are represented through graphs and a few fundamental properties of the graph which we would be using in the subsequent notebooks.\n",

    "Let us start with a **notion for a network**.\n",
    "Networks refer to the arrangement through which two or more computing devices can communicate with each other. The arrangement for communication can be through different media like wired, wireless connections or through visible light. \n",

    "## What is a network graph?\n",
    "\n",
    "Network graphs are representations of physical networks where the nodes represent the networking devices and the edges represent the links of the network. Network graphs are weighted graphs as in, the edge contain a weight which relates to link properties like latency, link speed, distance. Network graphs can also be either directed or undirected graphs. "

Each element in this matrix represents an edge, which is either denoted as (0,1) for an unweighted graph or with a value which corresponds to the weight of the edge. In our graph, for Node 1, we have three edges namely:\n",

The space saved in the memory also results in a faster lookups when adjacency lists are used. \n",
