    "### About the algorithm\n",
    "The idea behind Dijkstra's algorithm is to find the shortest path from a source Node to all the nodes (or) a specific target node on the graph without checking every source-to-destination combination, which in the worst case could be exponential in the number of vertices. Thus, considering every source-to-destination combination means that the computation of shortest path in large graphs becomes time consuming and cumbersome. Dijkstra's algorithm proposes a greedy approach, where at every iteration, the algorithm chooses a node with the current shortest distance and searches for paths extending from that node. We will make these statements clearer in coming sections.\n",

Consider Dijkstra's algorithm run on a directed, weighted graph represented as $G(V,E)$ where $V$ is the set of nodes of $G$ and E is the set of edges of $G$ which contain non-negative edges. Let $s$ denote the source node. For any node $u \\in V$, let $\\delta(u)$ denote the shortest path distance between node $s$ to node $u$. Let $d[u]$ denote the distance computed by Dijkstra's algorithm from source node $s$ to node $u$.\n",

    "To prove the correctness of Dijkstra's algorithm, we need to establish that $$d[u] = \\delta(u) \\quad  \\forall u \\in V.$$ We will show that the above equality is true at the moment when node $u$ is added to the set of visited nodes $S$. At any iteration, let $Q$ denote the set of not visited nodes, such that $V = S \\cup Q$. Once we establish the above equality at the moment of addition of node $u$ to $S$, we make use of the fact that the distance is not updated thereafter for node $u$ to establish the correctess at further time instances.\n",

    "\n",
    "After the first iteration, $S = \\{s\\}$ and $d[s] = \\delta(s) = 0$, thus satisfying the induction hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Induction step:* We show that for a new node $u$ added to visited set $S$, $d[u] = \\delta(u).$ We will prove this claim via contradiction. \n",

Let $P$ denote the optimal path from source $s$ to $u$ with distance $\\delta(u)$. Let the path $P$ be represented as $P = s-x^*-y-u$, where $x^*$ is the last element of $P$ in $S$, and let $y \\in Q$ be the first element just after $x^*$.
