    "# Bellmann Ford's Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Bellmann Ford algorithm computes the shortest path from the source node to the remaining nodes in the graph. The algorithm has a slower performance than the Dijkstra's algorithm for computing the shortest path, however, the Bellmann Ford algorithm is more verstaile since it can compute the shortest path in graphs which have some negative weighted edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of routing, [Distance-Vector Routing algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance-vector_routing_protocol) like the [Routing Information Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_Information_Protocol) uses a variant of the Bellmann-Ford algorithm where the number hops is the routing parameter. In practice, the Bellmann-Ford algorithm is run in a distributed setting, since it is run on individual nodes on the network.   \n",

For nodes which have non-negative edges, we find Dijkstra to be a faster and more efficient solution. However, when there are some edges that have negative weights, Dijkstra's algorithm is not able to correctly compute the shortest path. This is due to the greedy-decision making condition of selecting the node with the minimum distance. Bellmann-Ford on the other hand is able to handle the negative weights better."
