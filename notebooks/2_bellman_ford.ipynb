    "# Bellman-Ford Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "In an earlier section on Dijkstra's algorithm, we saw an algorithm to compute the shortest path between a source and destination in a graph. However, the Dikstra's algorithm requires the complete information of the graph to compute the shortest path. Thus on a computer network, if a node has to compute the shortest path with respect to itself, it will need the entire network information. Is there a way to compute the shortest path without having the complete view of the graph? Can we compute the shortest path in a distributed manner, where nodes help each other to figure out the shorted path? In this notebook, we introduce such an algorithm that can be executed in a distributed manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we introduce the Bellman-Ford algorithm that computes the shortest path from a source node to all remaining nodes in the graph. In practice, the Bellman-Ford algorithm is run in a distributed setting, where nodes update their distance metrics, and share their computed metrics with their neighbours. On reception of an updated metric from a neighbour, nodes update their own metrics, and then shares their updated metrics with their neighbours.\n",

    "In the context of routing, [Distance-Vector Routing algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance-vector_routing_protocol) like the [Routing Information Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_Information_Protocol) uses the Bellman-Ford algorithm to compute the routing metrics. \n",

For nodes which have non-negative edges, we find Dijkstra to be a faster and more efficient solution. However, when there are some edges that have negative weights, Dijkstra's algorithm is not able to correctly compute the shortest path. This is due to the greedy-decision making condition of selecting the node with the minimum distance. Bellman-Ford on the other hand is able to handle the negative weights better."

    "Let $G(V,E)$ be a weighted, directed graph where $V$ represents the set of all nodes and $E$ represents the set of all edges in the graph. Let $d_{k}[u]$ represent the distance computed by the algorithm after $k$ iterations, and $\\delta(u)$ represent the actual shortest distance existing from the source node $s$ to the target node $u$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*To Prove:* For a graph $G(V,E)$ with no negative weight cycles, $d_{|V|-1}[u] = \\delta(u)\\; \\forall u \\in V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider that node $t$ on the graph is reachable from the source node $s$, through a path $p$ such that $p = \\{v_{0}, v_{1},....., v_{K}\\}$ where $v_{0} = s$ and  $v_{K} = t$. Let path $p$ be the shortest path from the source node $s$ to node $t$ which means at most it has $|V| - 1$ edges as part of the path, thus, $K \\leq |V| - 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Claim :* For node $v_{l+1}$ in $p$, $\\delta(v_{l+1}) = \\delta(v_{l})+len(v_{l}, v_{l+1})$.\n",
    "If not, there exists another shorter path to $v_{l+1}$, and replacing the section of $p$ till $v_{l+1}$ with this shorter distance path will yield a total smaller distance to $t$. This contradicts the definition of $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now prove the correctness of the Bellman-Ford algorithm via induction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Induction hypothesis: If at iteration $k$, $d_{k}[v_{k}] = \\delta(v_{k})$. Then after $k+1$ iterations, $d_{k+1}[v_{k+1}] = \\delta(v_{k+1})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof:\n",
    "At iteration $k+1$,\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    " d_{k+1}[v_{k+1}] &= \\min\\{d_{k}[v_{k+1}], \\min_{u}(d_{k}[u]+len(u,v_{k+1}))\\}\\\\\n",
    " & \\le d_{k}[v_{k}] + len(v_{k}, v_{k+1})\\\\\n",
    " &= \\delta(v_{k}) + len(v_{k}, v_{k+1})\\\\\n",
    " & = \\delta(v_{k+1}),\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "where the first inequality follows as we are considering a particular term among all terms in the minimisation, the second equality follows from the induction hypothesis about $d_{k}[v_{k}]$, and the third equality follows from the claim above about $\\delta(v_{k+1})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we start the algorithm such that $d_{0}[s] = 0$ and $d_{0}[v] = \\infty$, for all $v \\in V \\setminus s$, the induction hypothesis is satisfied. Hence, the correctness of the Bellman-Ford algorithm is proved."
